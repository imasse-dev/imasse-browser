Imasse Browser is a React Native app that integrates the Imasse Search Engine (https://imasse.com) into a native IOS and Anroid web browser. 

This app is designed to run like any other web browser such as Safari on IOS and Chrome on Android with Imasse as the default search engine. The app will be able to generate citations for research papers, filtering results based on credibility, show a credibility check for each webpage similar to DuckDuckGo's privacy badge, and donates profits to education programs around the world.
